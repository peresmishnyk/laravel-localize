How to make all people happy
=============

Welcome to the documentation for phpDocumentor.

phpDocumentor is the de-facto documentation application for PHP projects. Your project can benefit too from more
than 20 years of experience and setting the standard for documenting PHP Applications.

With these tutorials, guides and references we aim to provide you with all the information that you need to optimally
document your code and leverage phpDocumentor to generate an extensive set of documentation for your application.

What does it do?
----------------

phpDocumentor analyzes the code of your application and generates a set of documentation that describes what each
element in your code does, what it expects and what it returns. With it, you can easily navigate through your codebase
and see how it works without having to read the actual code.

For an example on how that would look like, check the sidebar in
`our own documentation <https://docs.phpdoc.org/latest/>`_.

   There is a new feature underway to render handwritten documentation, like the one you are reading now. Check this
   space for updates in the coming months.

Where to start?
---------------

We have divided the documentation into 4 sections:

1. :doc:`chapter-1/index`, which is a series of concise tutorials that will help you get running within minutes.
2. :doc:`chapter-2/index`, these chapters provide in-depth information in the usage and all features of phpDocumentor.
